ðŸ“Š Electric Vehicles Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard that analyzes the adoption, distribution, and market trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The analysis covers both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
ðŸš— Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to:
Understand the growth and distribution of EVs across years, states, manufacturers, and models.
Compare BEVs and PHEVs in terms of adoption and market share.
Assess technological progress via average electric range.
Evaluate the impact of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility on adoption.
ðŸ“Œ KPIs
Total Vehicles
Overall count of EVs (BEVs + PHEVs) in the dataset.
Average Electric Range
The mean range of EVs to measure efficiency and progress.
Total BEVs & % of Total Vehicles
Total BEV count and their share of the EV market.
Total PHEVs & % of Total Vehicles
Total PHEV count and their share of the EV market.
